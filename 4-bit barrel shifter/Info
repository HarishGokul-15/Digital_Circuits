This is the implemenation of 4 bit barrel shifter using 4x1 mux. This would shift the data by the number of bits eg: If select line value is 0 no bits would be shifter, if the select line is 1 bit  the data is shifted by 1 bit

->  Write the verilog code for 4x1 mux
->  Create block design and import the module
->  Arrange the mux as per the specification of barrel shifter
->  Create Input and output port
->  Perform simulation to verify the result
