This folder contain implementation of UART Transceiver 
UART-Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter is suitable for small distance and low data rate application 
it contain 4 pin (2 pin for data transmission , 2 data pin for Vcc and ground)

This code contain the trigger of Baud rate logic, and followed by transmission of data bit with start bit 0  and stop bit 1

The input of system 1 would contain array of data to be sent as individually in serial mode

Serial transmission and recpetion is achieved by this project

The code contain the following logic
1. Baud clock trigger genration
2. Transmission logic
3. Reception logic
4. Testbench
